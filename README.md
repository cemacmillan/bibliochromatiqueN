# Open License Library

**An archive of creator-friendly, safety-minded licenses**

This repository collects open licenses that help artists, modders, researchers, and
educators share their work freely **without surrendering attribution or safety**.

Each license here can be used exactly as you would use source code:
copy it, adapt it, fork it, or import it into your own repository, subject to its terms.

---

## ✨ Purpose

- Preserve licenses that protect **freedom of expression** while guarding against misuse.  
- Encourage **non-commercial sharing** and **ethical remix** of art, code, and research.  
- Document how each license came to be needed and how it performed in the wild.  
- Provide clear, machine-readable SPDX identifiers so hosting platforms recognize them.

---

## 📁 Structure

- `/licenses/` — plain-text + markdown versions of each license
- `/recipes/` — cookbooks and rationales for using or creating licenses
- `/history/` — notes on lineage, case studies, and historical context

Example:

```
licenses/
  CAL-1.0.txt
  CAL-1.0.md
  Modder-1.3.txt
  Modder-1.3.md
recipes/
  making-your-own.md
  choosing-a-license.md
history/
  timeline.md
```

## ⚙️ Using a license

1. Copy the license text into your project's root as `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md`.  
2. Keep the **SPDX header line** at the top (note: this SPDX identifier is our own; please change the "CAL" portion to be unique for your license):

   ```
   SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-CAL-1.0
   ```

3. Mention the identifier in your `README`, manifest, or mod metadata.  
4. If you wish to include the mutual non-endorsement clause, use the `-N` variant:

   ```
   SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-CAL-1.0-N
   ```

## 🕊️ Ethics and Safety

This library is not a legal weapon.  
Licenses submitted here **must not** contain hate speech, coercive conditions, or
language that restricts identity, belief, or association.  
They exist to **enable creative exchange**, not to punish or exclude.
